# Client Setup

To set up and run the frontend of the project, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `client` folder:
   ```sh
   cd client
   ```

2. Install all dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the frontend server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

This will start the frontend on `http://localhost:3000/`. Open the link in your browser to access the application.
